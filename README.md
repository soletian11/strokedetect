# strokedetect
Capstone Project  part of ML Data Talks Club
Data has been downloaded from kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/discussion/392190
This data used to predict heart stroke based having below categorcial and numerical Features.

1.numerical=[ 'age',  'hypertension',  'heart_disease',  'avg_glucose_level',  'bmi','id']

2.categorical=['gender', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'residence_type', 'smoking_status']
      

We also have  "stroke" which is output variable and we will predict using various modesl and below we will list each of them
Binary Logistic Regression model ,because of response is binary either has stroke and no stroke.
I trained the data using Logistic Regression , Descion Tree and Random Forest.
Random gave amazing ROC AUC Score compared to LS and Decision Tree.
Random Forest has been trained with hyper paaremters to improve ROC AUC Scores.
