# strokedetect
Capstone Project  part of ML Data Talks Club
Data has been downloaded from kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/discussion/392190
This data used to predict heart stroke(yes/no) based having below categorcial and numerical Features.

      1.numerical=[ 'age',  'hypertension',  'heart_disease',  'avg_glucose_level',  'bmi','id']
      2.categorical=['gender', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'residence_type', 'smoking_status']
      

We also have  "stroke" which is output variable and  predict using various modesl and below are :
Expermimented using below models:

       1.Logistic Regression Model but did not good ROC_AUC Score.
       2.Decison Tree
       3.Random Forest


Outcome of Models:Trained dataset using different mentioned models and  tuned with different hyper params and random forest amaizng ROC_AUC Score .So RF ROC AUC Score is clealry evident from notebook.ipynn file 
Project Direcory:All files are tucked into midterm_projects
